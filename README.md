#Accusaga assignment

This assignment is done using google colab because my system doesn't have requirments supported for assignment.

if you are running in jupiter notebook use below line to import dataset

df = pd.read_csv("C:\\Users\\saiku\\Downloads\\Accusaga_DS_Assignment\\DS_dataset.csv")

if you use google colab then upload the dataset file usig the "file icon" which you can see in sidebar and then you need to select "upload the seasson storage" and select the dataset. Now the dataset is added to the seasson. Then select the dataset file path by right clicking on it and use the path in read_csv(). You can see an eample below

df = pd.read_csv("/content/DS_dataset.csv")
